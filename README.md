### 🃏 WHAT IS TWENTY-ONE?
**Twenty-One** is a typical blackjack game project I've worked on for first year college tasks, in which I added a personal sense of personality and thrill! I built upon this program using Visual Studio Code to accomodate the requirements my college expected of me.
## 📦 FEATURES AND TECHNOLOGY
**Twenty-One** was coded using Python 3.11 language using a command-line interface (CLI) to which it has features included but limited to:  
• Multiple human players competing simultaneously against one dealer;  
• A betting system where players wager each round;  
• A dealer following standard Blackjack rules;  
• Clear display of game states (cards, bets, balances, results);  
• A showing of achievements or titles being earned progressively; and  
• a lot more s-e-c-r-e-t-s to discover...
## 🕹️ THE PROCESS
I started by dealing with classes that are particularly foundational in terms of functionality such as Card, Deck, and Hand. These three classes are fundamental to the recurring rounds since methods used in higher classes are heavily based on the methods and attributes under these classes.  
Next, I started working on the Player first. I was contemplating whether I should create a parent class that would occupy both the needs of Player and Dealer class but I went against it since it would add another .py file (I assumed it is not allowed).  
To make sure that I made no mistakes, I intercepted the creation process by going back to the Three Foundational Classes i mentioned earlier. I noticed that my default Ace card value should be 11 instead of 1 from the research I made on other similar games (in Roblox and GTA SA).  
To allow myself freedom, I finally added the main game.py that would allow the five classes to work together. I started with the set-up players to ask_continue methods first, skipping the start method in order to keep myself uncontained in each method functionalities (which worked well). 
When I finished the full functionality, the biggest problem I encountered was creating an engaging gameplay. I fixed the UI first, adding newlines between responses using \n in strings as well as some typo fixes around the code (i.e. numetrical > numerical).  
It hit me afterwards that despite the UI fixes, the game was not entertaining me personally. I added a roleplay system setting the "INSTRUCTIONS" menu to be an introduction by a veteran human gambler and a bunny dealer with respective kakaomoji designs copied from the internet.  
Using this, I was able to create the idea to add delays between responses to create a more "realistic" timing between draw cards, responses, texts, quotes, system updates, and readability of the game.  
This way, I understood that finishing the school project was fine but not doing the best-est I could do would not improve my ability as a student. The funny thing is, now that I am documenting it, the more I realized that I am glad I am pursuing this field to learn more about my skillset that's been always varying since old days.
